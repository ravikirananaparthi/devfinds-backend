# Project Name: Dev Finds

## Overview

Welcome to the DevFinds' Work-Based Experience Sharing Platform! This platform is designed to facilitate programming students in capturing their work-based experiences and sharing them with other students. Users can share their learning experiences through text, photos, or videos, making it a versatile platform for knowledge exchange and collaboration.

## Features

-   **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and securely authenticate using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
-   **Real-time Communication**: Integration of Socket.io enables real-time communication between users, fostering instant interaction and collaboration.
-   **Database Management**: MongoDB is used as the database, with the Mongoose library for efficient data modeling and management.
-   **Cookie Parsing**: Cookie parsing is implemented for managing user sessions securely.
-   **Documentation**: The project is thoroughly documented to aid developers in understanding and contributing to the codebase.

## Technologies Used

-   **Express**: Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable web applications.
-   **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.
-   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure method for transmitting information between parties as JSON objects.
-   **Socket.io**: Library for real-time web applications, facilitating bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing and managing application data.
-   **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
-   **Cookie Parser**: Middleware for parsing HTTP request cookies, facilitating session management.
-   **ES6+**: Utilization of modern JavaScript features for enhanced code readability and maintainability.
